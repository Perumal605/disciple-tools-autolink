# Disciple.Tools - Autolink

A simple user interface for users to add churches and groups into Disciple Tools.

## Purpose

The Autolink plugin provides a simple way to create a specialized link for each person that is leading churches or training leaders. You can then send that custom link to the leader who can enter information about the groups and churches that they are leading and their current health status.

This provides a quick and easy way for you to track the health of churches and groups without having to create user account and passwords, and training local leaders how to use Disciple Tools. You can collect the data you need quickly from one simple link.

## Requirements

- Disciple.Tools Theme installed on a Wordpress Server

## Installing

- Install as a standard Disciple.Tools/Wordpress plugin in the system Admin/Plugins area.
- Requires the user role of Administrator.
